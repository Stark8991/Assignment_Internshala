Schema
-----------------------------------
Customers (customer_id, name, email)
Books (book_id, title, author, price)
Orders (order_id, customer_id, order_date)
OrderDetails (order_id, book_id, quantity)
---------------------------------------------

Q1) Write a SQL query to retrieve the top 5 customers who have purchased the most books(by total quantity) over the last year.

Ans:- SELECT c.name, newTable.total_quantity
		FROM Customers as c
		join (
			SELECT o.customer_id, SUM(od.quantity) as total_quantity
			FROM Orders as o
			JOIN OrderDetails as od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
			WHERE o.order_date >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 1 YEAR
			GROUP BY o.customer_id
			ORDER BY total_quantity DESC
			LIMIT 5
		) as newTable ON c.customer_id = newTable.customer_id;
		

Q2) Write a SQL query to calculate the total revenue generated from book sales by each author.

Ans:- SELECT b.author, SUM(od.quantity * b.price) as total_revenue
		FROM Books as b
		join OrderDetails as od ON b.book_id = od.book_id
		GROUP BY b.author;
	
Q3) Write a SQL query to retrieve all books that have been ordered more than 10 times, along with the total quantity ordered for each book.

Ans:- SELECT b.title, b.author, SUM(od.quantity) as total_quantity_ordered
		FROM Books as b
		join OrderDetails as od ON b.book_id = od.book_id
		GROUP BY b.book_id, b.title, b.author
		HAVING SUM(od.quantity) > 10;
